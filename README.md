# Why Does Machine Learning Fail for Small-Molecule Mass Spectrometry?

This repository accompanies our study on the limitations of current machine learning approaches for small-molecule mass spectrometry. 

We systematically investigate why modern ML models, despite strong performance on benchmark datasets, often fail to outperform simple baselines such as nearest neighbour. 

This repo contains:
- Instructions to download all the raw and processed data that were used in our analysis
- Code for processing the datasets 
- Code for reproducing all experiments and analyses
- Implementations of baseline and proposed methods
- Evaluation scripts and dataset processing pipelines
- Instructions for reproducing figures and tables from the paper
