# Why Does Machine Learning Fail for Small-Molecule Mass Spectrometry?

This repository accompanies our study on the limitations of current machine learning approaches for small-molecule mass spectrometry. 

We systematically investigate why modern ML models, despite strong performance on benchmark datasets, often fail to outperform simple baselines such as nearest neighbour.
