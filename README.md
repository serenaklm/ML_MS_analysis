## Understanding modelling limitations of LC-MS/MS data

1. Understanding the inputs to the model
The key analysis for this task is to understand what is the best representation that we can use for the MS. Some ideas include:

a. Binned
b. chemical formula 
c. structure

2. Understanding what is a difficult task 
a. Maybe if we predict things where the fragment is directly explainable by the peaks, it's easier
