# Why Does Machine Learning Fail for Small-Molecule Mass Spectrometry?

This repository accompanies our study on the limitations of current machine learning approaches for small-molecule mass spectrometry. 

We systematically investigate why modern ML models, despite strong performance on benchmark datasets, often fail to outperform simple baselines such as nearest neighbour.

## What we provide

We include all materials that can be legally shared:

- Preprocessing and data construction scripts  
- Train/test split definitions  
- Evaluation pipelines and metrics  
- Metadata and derived files that do not contain restricted spectra  
- Scripts to reproduce all results and figures  

These resources allow full reproduction of our experiments for open-sourced datasets.
